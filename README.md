# Flip/Reverse Text

It's easier this way

## Features

Creates the "localized" strings we need by flipping the text and inverting the case, just select the text and use CMD+shift+P to call the Flip/Reverse command.

> Tip: Make sure to one cursor for each line you want to transform.

## Requirements

Nothing. Enjoy!

## Known Issues

If you select multiple lines and call the Flip/Reverse command, the text will be flipped up and that's not what you want

## Release Notes

Probably only one release.
