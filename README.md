# Flip/Reverse Text

It's easier this way

## Features

Creates the "localized" strings we need by flipping the text and inverting the case.

## Requirements

Nothing. Enjoy!

## Installation

Currently this is not being distributed because it only makes sense to me and you reading this. If not then you shouldn't be reading this, so in order to install it you'll need to:

 - Download the `flip-reverse-text-0.0.1.vsix` file
 - Run: `code --install-extension flip-reverse-text-0.0.1.vsix`

## Usage

Select the text and use CMD+shift+P to call the Flip/Reverse command.

> Tip: Make sure to have one cursor for each line you want to transform.


## Known Issues

If you select multiple lines with the same cursor and call the Flip/Reverse command, the text will be flipped up including lines and that's not what you want

## Release Notes

Probably only one release.

### 1.0.0

Initial release of the extension

**Enjoy!**
